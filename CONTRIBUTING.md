# Contributing to Glow

Thank you for considering contributing to Glow! Your contributions help improve the project for everyone. Below you'll
find guidelines on how to get started.

## Issues and Proposals

We welcome bug reports, proposals, and feature requests. If you encounter a bug, have an idea for a new feature, or want
to propose changes, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. When opening an issue, please provide as much detail
as possible, including steps to reproduce any bugs and clear descriptions of proposed changes or features.

## Contributing Code

We appreciate code contributions from the community. Before you start working on any significant changes, please open an
issue to discuss your proposed changes. This helps ensure that your contributions align with the project's goals and
that there is no duplication of effort.

When contributing code, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you haven't already, fork the Glow repository on GitHub to your own account.

2. **Branch Strategy**: Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase
   and makes it easier to review and merge your contributions.

3. **Coding Standards**: Follow the coding standards and style conventions used in the project. Consistent coding style
   makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand.

4. **Tests**: If you're adding new functionality or fixing a bug, please include tests to ensure that your changes work
   as expected and do not introduce regressions.

5. **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation, including code comments, README files, and user guides, to
   reflect your changes.

6. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of each change. This helps
   other contributors understand your contributions and facilitates future maintenance.

7. **Pull Request**: Once you've made your changes, open a pull request against the main branch of the Glow repository.
   Provide a detailed description of your changes and any related issues.

8. **Review and Feedback**: Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers. Be responsive to any feedback or
   requests for changes. Collaboration and constructive feedback are essential to improving the quality of
   contributions.

9. **Merge**: Once your pull request has been approved and passes any required tests, it will be merged into the main
   codebase. Congratulations on your contribution!

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Glow. Your contributions help make the project better for everyone. If
you have any questions or need assistance with contributing, don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy coding!
